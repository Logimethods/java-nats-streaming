* [ADDED] Simplified connect API (See `NatsStreaming.connect(...)`)
* [ADDED] `Subscription::close(boolean unsubscribe)` to allow durable subscribers to close without unsubscribing.

* Bump jnats dependency to `jnats-0.7.3.jar`, which solves a thread exit problem in NATS.

## Version 0.4.0

_2016-10-30_    [GitHub Diff](https://github.com/nats-io/java-nats-streaming/compare/0.3.0...0.4.0)

* Added benchmark utility to examples.
* Updated functional/integration test coverage to match `go-nats-streaming` tests.
* Repository structure changes

## Version 0.3.0
